    sample_id.list contains the prefixes of the fastq files, which represent                                                   
the samples. the sample ID for L1_1000reads_1(2).fq is L1_1000reads. RNA-seq                                                   
pipeline will reconstruct the data file name using the sample ID. The                                                          
sample ID for the 8 demo data sets are:
L1_1000reads
L2_1000reads
L3_1000reads
L4_1000reads
L5_1000reads
L6_1000reads
L7_1000reads
L8_1000reads

3. Original data sets 
    The original data files of the 8 samples are in the directory "orignal",
    and they are not deposited in GitHub due to their large size.
