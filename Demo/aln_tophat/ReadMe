Demo for TopHat Wrapper: align_tophat_.sh                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                
Cleaned Raw Reads                                                                                                                        
   8 pair-end Illumina RNA-Seq data sets of Arabidopsis with 1000 reads                                                            
will be aligned to the reference genome sequence of Ensembl TAIR10 
using the tophat wrapper: align_tophat_.sh. The cleaned raw data is 
in RNA-seq/Demo/CleanedRawData, and the alignment output will be 
in the current demo directory.

TopHat Wrapper: align_tophat_.sh
   align_tophat_.sh is a wrapper for TopHat in order to process a batch
of RNA-seq data using the cluster condo.its.iastate.edu. 
  
Usage:
    ./align_tophat_.sh ./align_tophat.cfg sample_ID

To run the demo for one sample L1_1000reads in a computational node:
   qsub -I
   cd /TopHat/Wrapper/Demo/
   sh ./align_tophat_sample_L1.sh

or :
   qub -I
   cd /TopHat/Wrapper/Demo/
    sh ./align_tophat_.sh ./align_tophat_ath.cfg  L1_1000reads

To run the demo for 8 samples:
   qsub align_tophat.qsub.demo 

Files:
align_tophat_ath.cfg: contains the tophat input parameters for a specific
                      project regarding the genome, the read library, 
                      the thread number ...

sample_id.list: lists the prefix (sample ID) of the RNA-Seq raw data files.
                the sample ID is used to re-construct input/output file names.

align_tophat.qsub.demo: reads sample_id.list and distributes the alignment jobs to 
the computational node(s) using the command "parallel".

The output from TopHat is listed as following, and is not deposited in GitHub.
L1_1000reads.thout
L2_1000reads.thout
L3_1000reads.thout
L4_1000reads.thout
L5_1000reads.thout
L6_1000reads.thout
